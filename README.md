# Sorting Animations Program
This is a JavaFX program that can be used to visualize sorting animations
It allows the user to generate data that is random, ascending, or descending with their choice of the size
The user can then choose which algorithm to use to sort the data
The algorithms include: Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Shell Sort, Heap Sort, and three variations of QuickSort
